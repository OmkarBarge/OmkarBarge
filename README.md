Hello i'm Omkar Barge!
I’m a Python developer ,gaming enthusiast and a binge watcher and above all a good learner :) 

Over past several years, I’ve spend my time into polishing software skills which includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, Bootstrap Skills but over and above all I found interest in python and decided to stick to it.

Also I am bit inclined towards Data Analytics as well ,looking forward to learn and keep learning throughout the opportunities aligned for me in future.
Looking for opportunities as a Software developer/trainee or Data Analyst Intern
